1. What are the names of all the film categories in the database (sorted alphabetically)?
2. Return the last names (sorted alphabetically) of all the actors whose first name is Susan.
3. Find all the films whose length is more than 183 (exclusive). Order the results by the length (order films with the same length by their title). Return their title and the length.
4. Return the first name, last name and city of all the customers who live in Canada. Order the results first by the last name and then by the first name.
5. How many customers are from Aurora?
6. Return the "medium customer countries", namely, countries with more than 10 but less than 20 customers (exclusive). For each such country, return its name and number of customers. Order the result by the number of customers, in a descending order
7. In how many film categories is the difference between the film replacement cost and the rental rate, averaged over all the films in the category, larger than 17 (exclusive)?
8. Find and return the (full) names of all the actors who do not share their first name with any other actor, but share their last name with at least three other actors.
9. Find the names (first and last) of all the actors and costumers whose first name is the same as the first name of the actor with ID 8. Do not return the actor with ID 8 himself. Note that you cannot use the name of the actor with ID 8 as a constant (only the ID). There is more than one way to solve this question, but you need to provide only one solution.
10. Give an interesting query of your own that is not already in the assignment. The query should involve at least two joins, a HAVING clause and an aggregation operation. Provide the English/Hebrew explanation and the query output.
